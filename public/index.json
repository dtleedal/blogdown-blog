A very common use-case is to add a column to a table of data that indicates a category for each row where the category is dependent on the value of one of the table column. This task is so common it’s worth documenting here with an example. I’m a fan of data.table so I’ll set up a simple example using that.\n Get the package library(data.table) I’m going to make a table with 1000,000 randomly chosen US states then add a region column specifying which of the 5 US region each state belongs to. This approach requires a key table. Here is such a table:\n## Assign states to region W \u0026lt;- data.table(region = \u0026quot;W\u0026quot;, state = c(\u0026quot;AK\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;WA\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;OR\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;ID\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;MT\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;WY\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;CA\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;NV\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;UT\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;CO\u0026quot;)) MW \u0026lt;- data.table(region = \u0026quot;MW\u0026quot;, state = c(\u0026quot;ND\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;MN\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;WI\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;MI\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;SD\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;NE\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;KS\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;IA\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;MO\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;IL\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;IN\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;OH\u0026quot;)) NE \u0026lt;- data.table(region = \u0026quot;NE\u0026quot;, state = c(\u0026quot;NY\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;PA\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;MD\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;VT\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;ME\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;NH\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;MA\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;RI\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;CT\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;NJ\u0026quot;)) SE \u0026lt;- data.table(region = \u0026quot;SE\u0026quot;, state = c(\u0026quot;WV\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;DE\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;DC\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;VA\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;KY\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;NC\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;TN\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;AR\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;LA\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;MS\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;AL\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;GA\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;SC\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;FL\u0026quot;)) SW \u0026lt;- data.table(region = \u0026quot;SW\u0026quot;, state = c(\u0026quot;AZ\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;NM\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;OK\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;TX\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;HI\u0026quot;)) data.table has a useful row-binding command for combining a list of tables of the same column format into a single table:\nregion.key \u0026lt;- rbindlist(list(W, MW, NE, SE, SW)) ## Let\u0026#39;s look at a the first 15 rows: region.key[1:15, ] ## region state ## 1: W AK ## 2: W WA ## 3: W OR ## 4: W ID ## 5: W MT ## 6: W WY ## 7: W CA ## 8: W NV ## 9: W UT ## 10: W CO ## 11: MW ND ## 12: MW MN ## 13: MW WI ## 14: MW MI ## 15: MW SD  Make some test data When developing, making manageable test data is really important. Here I’m making 1000,000 example rows that represent the type of data you might encounter in the wild.\n## Make a large set of randomly chosen states and some other random content. random.dt \u0026lt;- data.table(state = sample(region.key$state, 1000000, replace = TRUE), other.info = sample(1:100, 1000000, replace = TRUE)) ## Look at the first 15 rows: random.dt[1:15, ] ## state other.info ## 1: NH 57 ## 2: MA 19 ## 3: CO 9 ## 4: DC 67 ## 5: NV 1 ## 6: GA 19 ## 7: NC 55 ## 8: PA 7 ## 9: IL 21 ## 10: VA 16 ## 11: VT 77 ## 12: AL 52 ## 13: WY 97 ## 14: VA 94 ## 15: PA 35  Add category So now we have some test data. For many reasons I might want to add a column stating which region each state belongs to. For example I might want to colour code a plot, or perform grouping operations by region. So I’m going to add the region category by merging the data with the key table. The most error-proof way to do this is to have a key column in both tables. The first way I’ll show is to do this simply by having a common column name as we have here with state. If we have a common name we can merge using that name:\ncommon.name.dt \u0026lt;- merge(random.dt, region.key, by = \u0026quot;state\u0026quot;, sort=FALSE) ## Look at first 15 rows: common.name.dt[1:15, ] ## state other.info region ## 1: NH 57 NE ## 2: MA 19 NE ## 3: CO 9 W ## 4: DC 67 SE ## 5: NV 1 W ## 6: GA 19 SE ## 7: NC 55 SE ## 8: PA 7 NE ## 9: IL 21 MW ## 10: VA 16 SE ## 11: VT 77 NE ## 12: AL 52 SE ## 13: WY 97 W ## 14: VA 94 SE ## 15: PA 35 NE ## success! data.table has a very sophisticated key hashing system whereby one or more columns can be specified as the key column(s), these get hashed so that subsequent sorting, searching and merging operations are extremely fast. For an example like this, the difference is not really noticeable, but it’s a good skill to have so here goes:\nsetkey(random.dt, \u0026quot;state\u0026quot;) setkey(region.key, \u0026quot;state\u0026quot;) ## Calling merge without specifying a column will default to merging using the columns defined as the key. common.name.dt.2 \u0026lt;- merge(random.dt, region.key, sort=FALSE) ## top 15 rows: common.name.dt.2[1:15, ] ## state other.info region ## 1: AK 83 W ## 2: AK 77 W ## 3: AK 39 W ## 4: AK 92 W ## 5: AK 51 W ## 6: AK 94 W ## 7: AK 2 W ## 8: AK 36 W ## 9: AK 65 W ## 10: AK 36 W ## 11: AK 46 W ## 12: AK 50 W ## 13: AK 70 W ## 14: AK 34 W ## 15: AK 40 W It’s important to note that setting a key column automatically sorts the table in alphabetic or numeric order depending on the data type. This could cause errors if I’d wanted to column-bind tables and had forgotten setkey changed the order or rows. I’d suggest always using a reference column and merging tables rather than using column-binding unless you’re confident about the row order.\n Using the category It’s worth showing a quick example of using the new category column: a group operation. I’ll show the mean of the other.info column grouped by region.\nregion.means \u0026lt;- common.name.dt.2[, mean(other.info), by = \u0026quot;region\u0026quot;] ## Change the default returned column name from V1 to mean.value setnames(region.means, old = \u0026quot;V1\u0026quot;, new = \u0026quot;mean.value\u0026quot;) region.means[] ## region mean.value ## 1: W 50.52804 ## 2: SE 50.60265 ## 3: SW 50.58154 ## 4: NE 50.55172 ## 5: MW 50.50551  Summary There are so many times when I need to assign rows to a higher category. Best way is to keep it simple, make a key table, then merge the two tables. Once you have one or more columns of categories it’s very easy to perform sophisticated pivot-type operations on groups of rows.\n ","date":1599523200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1599565440,"objectID":"6b8a4e8e44b56589872c37cb02b2ee9a","permalink":"/post/quick-and-easy-classification-column-data-table/","publishdate":"2020-09-08T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/quick-and-easy-classification-column-data-table/","section":"post","summary":"Quickly add higher-level classification column to data.

I’m kicking off this blog with a geospatial example. I did some work recently where I needed to know:\n the nearest section of highway to a given point; and, the highways’s approximate bearing.  I got this working pretty well and am repeating the crux of the solution here. As an aside, while I was doing this work I came across Geoff Boeing’s beautiful post visualising similar aggregate directional information for 25 cities - definitely worth a look.\nThe best approach I could think of was to use OpenStreetMap data. Firstly associate a point with it’s nearest highway ‘way’ feature. Then get the coordinates of the beginning and end of the feature and use the pair of points to define a bearing. Makes sense? OK, here we go:\n Get the packages library(geosphere) library(sf) library(leaflet) library(osmdata) library(data.table) library(ggmap)  Organise the data To keep things manageable I’m going to use 4 points dotted around the Northern Quarter in Manchester (UK). I’ll put them in a data.frame:\ndf \u0026lt;- data.frame(ID = 1:4, Longitude = c(-2.232086, -2.235675, -2.233628, -2.232453), Latitude = c(53.484510, 53.484318, 53.484103, 53.481176), stringsAsFactors = FALSE) Then I’ll convert to an sf (spatial features) multi point object. I use this command over and over.\ndf.sf \u0026lt;- st_as_sf(df, coords = c(\u0026quot;Longitude\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Latitude\u0026quot;), crs=4326) The crs argument is telling st_as_sf that these coordinates are WGS84 by referencing the appropriate EPSG code 4326 (it’s a good idea to memorise that number!). This is needed later when I project the points out of latitude/longitude format and into distance-from-bottom-left format. If you’re not familiar with this concept here’s a good pdf tutorial.\n Visualise At this point I’ll take a look at the 4 points.

The result is an osmdata object containing various items. The item I’m interested in is the osm_lines which is a set of sf linestrings. These are the way objects representing highway segments.

This won’t make much difference here but does provide a big speed up when there’s thousands of highways to choose from. Also you can, if needed, put this code in a loop and grow or shrink the buffer distance until a suitable number of candidate highways are found. First step is to project the points and the road segments to a suitable coordinate reference system (for Manchester, the UK Ordnance Survay EPSG: 27700 is a good choice), apply a 50m buffer to the points, then identify which road segments intersect with this buffer.\ndf.sf.tf \u0026lt;- st_transform(df.sf, 27700) # OSGB 1936 British National Grid CRS road.lines.tf \u0026lt;- st_transform(road.lines, 27700) buffer.size \u0026lt;- 50 df.sf.tf.bf \u0026lt;- st_buffer(df.sf.tf, buffer.size) intersected.items \u0026lt;- st_intersects(df.sf.tf.bf, road.lines.tf, sparse = F) dim(intersected.items) ## [1] 4 44 The dimensions show I have 4 rows, one for each of the 4 points, and 44 columns, one for each OSM road segment within the bounding box. The matrix contains TRUE/FALSE values where TRUE indicates a point of intersection.\n Get the closest road segment So now, using the location of TRUE values in each row or the intersected.items matrix, I can subset the road.lines so that the nearest highway search is constrained to a much smaller number of highway segments (ones within 50m). The st_coordinates function is useful to return just the coordinate information from an sf object, and the dist2Line function from the geosphere package calculates the shortest distance between a point and a polyline (There are some good details about doing this type of calculation at the Movable Type website.\nnumber.of.point \u0026lt;- nrow(intersected.items) distances.vect \u0026lt;- matrix(NA_real_, nrow = nrow(df.sf.tf), ncol = 4) colnames(distances.vect) \u0026lt;- c(\u0026quot;distance\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;lon\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;lat\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;ID\u0026quot;) for (i in seq_len(number.of.point)) { # Out of all 44 road segments, get the index of the ones that are within 50m of point i. original.road.idx \u0026lt;- which(intersected.items[i, ] == TRUE) distances.vect.temp \u0026lt;- dist2Line(p = st_coordinates(df.sf[i, ]), line = as_Spatial(road.lines[original.road.idx, ])) distances.vect.temp[1, \u0026quot;ID\u0026quot;] \u0026lt;- original.road.idx[distances.vect.temp[1, \u0026quot;ID\u0026quot;]] distances.vect[i, ] \u0026lt;- distances.vect.temp } distances.vect ## distance lon lat ID ## [1,] 5.061288 -2.232137 53.48448 43 ## [2,] 3.500525 -2.235712 53.48430 10 ## [3,] 6.111912 -2.233558 53.48407 5 ## [4,] 5.541079 -2.232491 53.48122 19 So now I’ve got the nearest road segments and the coordinates of the nearest point on the road segments to the original points. These are stored in the lon/lat columns of distances.vec. So the original vague points are now snapped to actual highway locations which is a bonus.\n Get the road section bearings Next I’ll extract the chosen 4 road segments from the full set of 44 and add the useful features I’ve just created so far. Getting the coordinates of the first and last points is a bit fiddly. I’m using data.table for this. When retrieving the coordinates via st_coordinates a third column labelled L1 is created with a group ID of each polyline object. This can be used as a grouping variable in data.table. The .SD[...] syntax holds the sub-data.table once the full data.table has been split by the grouping variable, finally 1 and .N are the first row and last row of each sub-data.table. There’s other ways to do this but the speed of data.table would pay off if I had thousands of points. Once we have the beginning and end coordinate pairs it’s straightforward to call the bearing function from the geosphere package.\nout \u0026lt;- road.lines[as.integer(distances.vect[, \u0026quot;ID\u0026quot;]), ] out$dist.to.nearest \u0026lt;- distances.vect[, \u0026quot;distance\u0026quot;] out$snap.lat \u0026lt;- distances.vect[, \u0026quot;lat\u0026quot;] out$snap.lon \u0026lt;- distances.vect[, \u0026quot;lon\u0026quot;] matching.road.lines.coords \u0026lt;- data.table::as.data.table(st_coordinates(out)) matching.road.lines.coords.begin \u0026lt;- as.matrix(matching.road.lines.coords[, .SD[1, .(X, Y)], by = \u0026quot;L1\u0026quot;][, L1 := NULL]) matching.road.lines.coords.end \u0026lt;- as.matrix(matching.road.lines.coords[, .SD[.N, .(X, Y)], by = \u0026quot;L1\u0026quot;][, L1 := NULL]) matching.road.lines.bearing \u0026lt;- bearing(matching.road.lines.coords.begin, matching.road.lines.coords.end) out$bearing \u0026lt;- (matching.road.lines.bearing + 360) %% 360 out$bearing ## [1] 133.2409 316.6075 217.5574 258.1974  Plot with estimated bearing In order to visualise the estimated road bearing for my 4 points I need to add arrow endpoints information. Some trigonometry wil accomplish this (the 0.00025 value is determines the length of the direction arrow):\nout$delta.x \u0026lt;- sin((pi*out$bearing) / 180) * 0.00025 out$delta.y \u0026lt;- cos((pi*out$bearing) / 180) * 0.00025 Now I can plot the snapped locations and show an arrow indicating the highway bearing over a basemap which is not only pretty but allows for a quick visual validation.\n# A handcoded bounding box for tile retrieval. A function to make this would be a nice addition. n.quarter.bb \u0026lt;- c(left = -2.236, bottom = 53.48, right = -2.23, top = 53.485) n.quarter \u0026lt;- get_stamenmap(bbox = n.quarter.bb, zoom = 18, messaging = FALSE) ggmap(n.quarter) + geom_point(data = out, aes(x=snap.lon, y=snap.lat), colour = \u0026quot;darkgreen\u0026quot;, size = 4) + geom_segment(data = out, aes(x=snap.lon, y=snap.lat, xend = snap.lon + delta.x, yend = snap.lat + delta.y), colour = \u0026quot;darkgreen\u0026quot;, arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.2,\u0026quot;cm\u0026quot;)))  Summary The results are pretty good, definitely good enough to classify a point into one of the 8 compass bearing directions: N, NE, E… etc. In this post I’ve explored working with sf spatial points, generated and run an OSM overpass filter, and done some useful visualisation with Leaflet and ggmap.
