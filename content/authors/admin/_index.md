I've been applying computational science to various problems for 20 years. First as a research scientist studying flood risk management and geoengineering assessment and more recently in the private sector on environmental, insurance, and site planning projects. I'm hugely appreciative of the Open Source community - I've learnt so much from the posts and tutorials generously supplied by others. I mostly work with R. This is my contribution, it's partly a place for me to make a record of methods I've used that have worked so that I can find them again, and partly a means to share those methods in the hope they might help someone else. Keep the community vibrant. UseR.
