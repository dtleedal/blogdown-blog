<div id="given-a-point-what-highway-is-it-on-and-what-direction-does-that-highway-go" class="section level3">
<h3>Given a point, what highway is it on and what direction does that highway go?</h3>
<p>I’m kicking off this blog with a geospatial example. I did some work recently where I needed to know:</p>
<ul>
<li>the nearest section of highway to a given point; and,</li>
<li>the highways’s approximate bearing.</li>
</ul>
<p>I got this working pretty well and am repeating the crux of the solution here. As an aside, while I was doing this work I came across <a href="https://geoffboeing.com/2018/07/comparing-city-street-orientations/">Geoff Boeing’s beautiful post</a> visualising similar aggregate directional information for 25 cities - definitely worth a look.</p>
<p>The best approach I could think of was to use OpenStreetMap data. Firstly associate a point with it’s nearest highway ‘way’ feature. Then get the coordinates of the beginning and end of the feature and use the pair of points to define a bearing. Makes sense? OK, here we go:</p>
</div>
<div id="get-the-packages" class="section level3">
<h3>Get the packages</h3>
<pre class="r"><code>library(geosphere)
library(sf)
library(leaflet)
library(osmdata)
library(data.table)
library(ggmap)</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="organise-the-data" class="section level3">
<h3>Organise the data</h3>
<p>To keep things manageable I’m going to use 4 points dotted around the Northern Quarter in Manchester (UK). I’ll put them in a data.frame:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>df &lt;- data.frame(ID = 1:4,
 Longitude = c(-2.232086, -2.235675, -2.233628, -2.232453),
 Latitude = c(53.484510, 53.484318, 53.484103, 53.481176), stringsAsFactors = FALSE)</code></pre>
<p>Then I’ll convert to an <code>sf</code> (spatial features) multi point object. I use this command over and over.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>df.sf &lt;- st_as_sf(df, coords = c(&quot;Longitude&quot;, &quot;Latitude&quot;), crs=4326)</code></pre>
<p>The crs argument is telling st_as_sf that these coordinates are WGS84 by referencing the appropriate EPSG code 4326 (it’s a good idea to memorise that number!). This is needed later when I project the points out of latitude/longitude format and into distance-from-bottom-left format. If you’re not familiar with this concept <a href="https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/sites/default/files/2020-04/OverviewCoordinateReferenceSystems.pdf">here’s a good pdf tutorial</a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="visualise" class="section level3">
<h3>Visualise</h3>
<p>At this point I’ll take a look at the 4 points. I’m using leaflet which works well with Blogdown.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>m &lt;- leaflet(df) %&gt;% addTiles() %&gt;% addCircleMarkers(

<h3>Get information from OpenStreetMap</h3>
<p>The <code>opq</code> query from the <code>osmdata</code> package forms an OSM overpass filter and sends it to OSM’s servers. The result is an <code>osmdata</code> object containing various items. The item I’m interested in is the <code>osm_lines</code> which is a set of <code>sf</code> linestrings. These are the way objects representing highway segments. The query has returned 44 highway segments that intersected the bounded box of our 4 points (at the time of posting).</p>

<div id="get-candidate-closest-roads-to-points" class="section level3">
<h3>Get candidate closest roads to points</h3>
<p>Before finding the closest highway segment to a point, I’ll narrow down the search by first identifying all the highway segments within a fixed distance of each point. This won’t make much difference here but does provide a big speed up when there’s thousands of highways to choose from. Also you can, if needed, put this code in a loop and grow or shrink the buffer distance until a suitable number of candidate highways are found. First step is to project the points and the road segments to a suitable coordinate reference system (for Manchester, the UK Ordnance Survay EPSG: 27700 is a good choice), apply a 50m buffer to the points, then identify which road segments intersect with this buffer.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>df.sf.tf &lt;- st_transform(df.sf, 27700) # OSGB 1936 British National Grid CRS
road.lines.tf &lt;- st_transform(road.lines, 27700)
buffer.size &lt;- 50
df.sf.tf.bf &lt;- st_buffer(df.sf.tf, buffer.size)
intersected.items &lt;- st_intersects(df.sf.tf.bf, road.lines.tf, sparse = F)
dim(intersected.items)
## [1]  4 44</code></pre>
<p>The dimensions show I have 4 rows, one for each of the 4 points, and 44 columns, one for each OSM road segment within the bounding box. The matrix contains TRUE/FALSE values where TRUE indicates a point of intersection.</p>
</div>
<div id="get-the-closest-road-segment" class="section level3">
<h3>Get the closest road segment</h3>
<p>So now, using the location of TRUE values in each row or the <code>intersected.items</code> matrix, I can subset the <code>road.lines</code> so that the nearest highway search is constrained to a much smaller number of highway segments (ones within 50m).
The <code>st_coordinates</code> function is useful to return just the coordinate information from an <code>sf</code> object, and the <code>dist2Line</code> function from the <code>geosphere</code> package calculates the shortest distance between a point and a polyline (There are some good details about doing this type of calculation at the <a href="https://www.movable-type.co.uk/scripts/latlong.html">Movable Type website</a>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>number.of.point &lt;- nrow(intersected.items)
distances.vect &lt;- matrix(NA_real_, nrow = nrow(df.sf.tf), ncol = 4)
colnames(distances.vect) &lt;- c(&quot;distance&quot;, &quot;lon&quot;, &quot;lat&quot;, &quot;ID&quot;)
for (i in seq_len(number.of.point)) {
  # Out of all 44 road segments, get the index of the ones that are within 50m of point i. 
  original.road.idx &lt;- which(intersected.items[i, ] == TRUE)
  distances.vect.temp  &lt;- dist2Line(p = st_coordinates(df.sf[i, ]), line = as_Spatial(road.lines[original.road.idx, ]))
  distances.vect.temp[1, &quot;ID&quot;] &lt;- original.road.idx[distances.vect.temp[1, &quot;ID&quot;]]
  distances.vect[i, ] &lt;- distances.vect.temp
}
distances.vect
##      distance       lon      lat ID
## [1,] 5.061288 -2.232137 53.48448 43
## [2,] 3.500525 -2.235712 53.48430 10
## [3,] 6.111912 -2.233558 53.48407  5
## [4,] 5.541079 -2.232491 53.48122 19</code></pre>
<p>So now I’ve got the nearest road segments <em>and</em> the coordinates of the nearest point on the road segments to the original points. These are stored in the lon/lat columns of <code>distances.vec</code>. So the original vague points are now <em>snapped</em> to actual highway locations which is a bonus.</p>
</div>
<div id="get-the-road-section-bearings" class="section level3">
<h3>Get the road section bearings</h3>
<p>Next I’ll extract the chosen 4 road segments from the full set of 44 and add the useful features I’ve just created so far. Getting the coordinates of the first and last points is a bit fiddly. I’m using <code>data.table</code> for this. When retrieving the coordinates via <code>st_coordinates</code> a third column labelled <code>L1</code> is created with a group ID of each polyline object. This can be used as a grouping variable in data.table. The <code>.SD[...]</code> syntax holds the sub-data.table once the full data.table has been split by the grouping variable, finally 1 and <code>.N</code> are the first row and last row of each sub-data.table. There’s other ways to do this but the speed of <code>data.table</code> would pay off if I had thousands of points.
Once we have the beginning and end coordinate pairs it’s straightforward to call the <code>bearing</code> function from the <code>geosphere</code> package.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>out &lt;- road.lines[as.integer(distances.vect[, &quot;ID&quot;]), ]
out$dist.to.nearest &lt;- distances.vect[, &quot;distance&quot;]
out$snap.lat &lt;- distances.vect[, &quot;lat&quot;]
out$snap.lon &lt;- distances.vect[, &quot;lon&quot;]
matching.road.lines.coords &lt;- data.table::as.data.table(st_coordinates(out))
matching.road.lines.coords.begin &lt;- as.matrix(matching.road.lines.coords[, .SD[1, .(X, Y)], by = &quot;L1&quot;][, L1 := NULL])
matching.road.lines.coords.end &lt;- as.matrix(matching.road.lines.coords[, .SD[.N, .(X, Y)], by = &quot;L1&quot;][, L1 := NULL])
matching.road.lines.bearing &lt;- bearing(matching.road.lines.coords.begin, matching.road.lines.coords.end)
out$bearing &lt;- (matching.road.lines.bearing + 360) %% 360
out$bearing
## [1] 133.2409 316.6075 217.5574 258.1974</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="plot-with-estimated-bearing" class="section level3">
<h3>Plot with estimated bearing</h3>
<p>In order to visualise the estimated road bearing for my 4 points I need to add arrow endpoints information. Some trigonometry wil accomplish this (the 0.00025 value is determines the length of the direction arrow):</p>
<pre class="r"><code>out$delta.x &lt;- sin((pi*out$bearing) / 180) * 0.00025
out$delta.y &lt;- cos((pi*out$bearing) / 180) * 0.00025</code></pre>
<p>Now I can plot the snapped locations <em>and</em> show an arrow indicating the highway bearing over a basemap which is not only pretty but allows for a quick visual validation.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># A handcoded bounding box for tile retrieval. A function to make this would be a nice addition.

ggmap(n.quarter) + 
  geom_point(data = out, aes(x=snap.lon, y=snap.lat), colour = &quot;darkgreen&quot;, size = 4) +
  geom_segment(data = out, aes(x=snap.lon, y=snap.lat, xend = snap.lon + delta.x, yend = snap.lat + delta.y), colour = &quot;darkgreen&quot;, arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.2,&quot;cm&quot;)))</code></pre>

<div id="summary" class="section level3">
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>The results are pretty good, definitely good enough to classify a point into one of the 8 compass bearing directions: N, NE, E… etc. In this post I’ve explored working with <code>sf</code> spatial points, generated and run an OSM overpass filter, and done some useful visualisation with <code>Leaflet</code> and <code>ggmap</code>. I’m sure there are things I could tidy and optimise here but I hope you found this a little useful.</p>
